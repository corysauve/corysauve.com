intro: |
  I currently work as an aquatic ecologist for an environmental consulting firm. Most of my work is focused on using image classification and machine learning to better monitor aquatic systems and respond to changing water quality. I'm also building data-driven visualizations for the state-wide lake monitoring program in Indiana.
  
  In my free time, I enjoy exploring the outdoors, cooking, and using data science to work with environmental and fantasy football data.
