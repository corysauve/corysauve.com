title: The Use of Imaging Flow Cytometry for Algal Monitoring and Classification
---

**Abstract**

Imaging flow cytometry presents a powerful tool for assessing phytoplankton assemblages. Flow cytometry increases processing capacity compared to traditional sampling strategies, while still maintaining some detailed assemblage information. This increased capacity and reduced per-sample turnaround time allows for the targeted use of flow cytometry in harmful cyanobacteria bloom monitoring and large-scale ecological assessment. However, caution should be used when applying this technology given that it requires expert knowledge of algal taxonomy and a clear understanding of monitoring goals. Here, we discuss the considerations that must be taken to effectively operate a flow cytometer to process and classify phytoplankton samples. We cover aspects of sample processing, data extraction, strategies for classification, and applications of flow cytometry for algal analysis. These considerations are based on our experience operating an Imaging FlowCytobot (IFCB) in production for over four years and processing over 2,700 phytoplankton samples.
