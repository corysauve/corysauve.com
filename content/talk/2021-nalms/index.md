title: Comparison of Imaging Flow Cytometry and Manual Counts for Assessing Ecological Status and Harmful Cyanobacterial Bloom Monitoring
---

**Abstract**

Numerous sampling and analytical methods exist to assess ecological status and to monitor harmful cyanobacterial 
blooms (HCBs) in freshwater systems. Imaging flow cytometry presents a powerful tool for assessing phytoplankton 
assemblages as it reduces processing time when compared to manual counts while maintaining an intermediate level 
of taxonomic detail. This increased capacity and reduced processing time makes flow cytometry an effective method 
for HCB monitoring and large-scale ecological assessment. This presentation will compare manual counts and results 
from the Imaging Flow Cytobot (IFCB) for two projects in New York. Preserved and live samples from two lakes in 
the Finger Lakes region and preserved samples from one lake in the Adirondack region were included in the analysis, 
with 22 and 20 sampling events in each region, respectively. Each sample was analyzed using both manual counts 
and the IFCB. Comparisons between the manual and IFCB counts are analyzed using multidimensional scaling, 
specifically focusing on differences between functional groups, species classes, and critical water indicators such as 
HCB species. The differences between live and preserved samples are also compared.
